## Netflix Navigator

This is a web application developed with Shiny that allows users to interact with data on movies and TV shows offered on Netflix (data last updated in 2019).

It consists of three major features:

1. **Analysis**: Users can view the distribution of a particular feature (i.e. genre, duration) of either movies or TV shows

2. **Recommendation**: Users can select preferences for features of a movie or TV show and receive up to 3 recommendations for movies or TV shows that fit those criteria that are available on Netflix. 

3. **Regression**: Users can view linear regression models for quantitative variables of movies or TV shows
